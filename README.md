# Test task for Dev-Pro company #

### Getting started

    git clone https://github.com/feriatos/dev-pro-test-task.git
    cd dev-pro-test-task
    composer install
    php index.php
       
### Information ###

Source file with words to parse contains 466544 words. 
Because of that script runs approximately 78 hours (on my laptop).
So I didn't test it fully.  

Also there could be a problem with too many requests to website, 
when google captcha appears.
